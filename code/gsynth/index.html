This site has been down for some time because it has been lost to a
disk crash.  I've restored what I could, but the source and win32 port
is gone from this site.  Grab source from SourceForge.  Aside from
that, this project hasn't seen any activity in a very long time, so
don't expect any progress anytime soon.  By all means, steal the
source code for your own projects (which you actually have time to
work on!).  The gsyn synthesizer is a lot of fun.<br><br>

   <FONT COLOR=#4466FF SIZE=+3>About</FONT><BR>
	First: there has been some confusion about this project.  is it
gsyn, or is it gsynth?  well, <a href="gsyn.gif">this screenshot</a>
is gsyn, a little dual-303-like toy with a really old <a
href="gsynth0.1.zip">win32 port</a>, where as <a
href="gsynth.gif">this one</a> is gsynth, which is something else
entirely.  the latter simply evolved from the former; they both use
the same synthesizer code.<br><br>

	gsynth is designed to be an extensible, modular synthesizer. 

    The interface allows the user to add several modules into a virtual analog machine which is then wired together using a simple mouse interface.  Each module can be programmed in tracker fashion, and each pattern can be sequenced in the order editor.<BR><BR>

	gsynth currently functions under Linux, IRIX, and Solaris.
FreeBSD sound will be forthcoming soon [read: not soon], as will [won't]
a win32 port.<br><br>

	Please see the <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gsynth/">sourceforge</a>
page for the latest status.<br><br>

    <FONT COLOR=#4466FF SIZE=+3>Authors</FONT><BR>
	gsynth was originally written by <a
href="http://www.a1k0n.net/">Andy Sloane</a> &lt;<a
href="mailto:andy+gsyn@a1k0n.net">andy@a1k0n.net</a>&gt;.  The Windows
port and WaveOut sound driver is written by <a
href="http://www.ratelis.com/">Ray Ratelis</a>.<BR><BR>

    <FONT COLOR=#4466FF SIZE=+3>Download</FONT><BR>
	You can always get the latest gsynth source from sourceforge CVS;
instructions for doing so are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=32332">here</a>.  The
<i>modulename</i> in these instructions is <b>gsynth</b> for the
gsynth code and <b>moduleapi</b> for the little module development
kit.  also, when building from cvs sources you must use the
<b>autogen.sh</b> script to build the <b>configure</b> script.<br><br>

I'm afraid all the local copies of the source, including the old gsyn
version, have been lost to a disk crash.<br><br>

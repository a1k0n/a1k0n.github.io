<hr>
<p />To use: Install the script above (if you don't have <a
  href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a>
installed, do that first).  Log into the game via Facebook.
Right-click on the game and choose <b>This Frame</b> -&gt; <b>Show
  Only This Frame</b>.
Then right click on the monkey, <b>User Script Commands...</b> -&gt;
<b>Start auto-upgrading</b>.  It will continuously start the available
building upgrades and research that takes the least time until you
choose the <b>Stop auto-upgrading</b> option, thus freeing you to
sleep or go about your day.

<p />It is biased towards farm/mine/quarry/sawmill/cottage upgrades; it
will choose one of those that takes up to fifteen minutes shorter than
a non-field/cottage upgrade.

<p />Research prioritizes fletching above all else, but beyond that it
is least-time only.

<p />You will probably want to modify the above prioritizations to
suit your current game.

<p />You will also want to set your tax rate exactly equal to your
tavern level (e.g. with a level 7 tavern, use a 7% tax rate).  This
script will automatically levy gold as soon as your happiness reaches
100% (i.e. every two hours).  This nets you 5*(population limit) gold
per hour.  This is a lot of gold.

<p />This unfortunately will only operate on the currently-open city,
not any of your other cities.  It wouldn't be too hard to support all
cities, though; in fact it would be very easy, but I only have one
city so I have no way to test.

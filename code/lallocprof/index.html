<h2>Lua Memory Profiler</h2>
<p>This is a memory profiler I threw together for Lua 5.0.  It works
like this:</p>

<p>First, I hooked realloc() and free() in lmem.c to point to my own
debug_realloc and debug_free functions, and I also created a Lua line
hook.  My debug realloc and free functions push a note of the
operation (it's a struct that contains operation type, pointer, size,
oldsize) into an internal queue, which is read by the line hook
function.  So on each line, it keeps track of what was allocated and
what was freed.  The realloc/free/line hook functions are all written
in C++ using handy STL containers (deque, map, multimap).</p>

<p>The first thing I tried was to get a stack dump inside the realloc and
free functions, but that just caused a huge mess; the line hook thing
works better.  It still may not be terribly accurate but it does give
you a general idea of where your hotspots are.</p>

<p>Lua 5.1 is supposedly going to have support for getting the actual
memory consumption of a particular table, which is really all I wanted
in the first place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have any sample output handy.  But it gives
you two profiles: currently allocated and total garbage.  By default
it stores allocation/free counts per-line but you can change it to
per-function by removing the line hook and only using the call/return
hooks.</p>

<p>It will probably take a little bit of effort to merge this into your
own Lua program.</p>

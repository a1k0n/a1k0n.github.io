  <title>mostly broken sort of adlib</title>
</head>
<p>this sort of sounds like adlib / Yamaha YM3812 / OPL2, but not quite --
working on sorting out the bugs, reverse engineering proper envelopes, etc.
uses the same log-sin and exponential lookup tables as the real chip.</p>

<p>update 10/16/2016: portamento, vibrato implemented, fixed some envelope
issues. crooner.d00 is feature-complete, just needs tuning.</p>

<p>non-FM instrument mode still not supported in opl2 emulator, spfx not
supported in d00 player.</p>

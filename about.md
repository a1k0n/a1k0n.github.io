I'm Andy Sloane and I write all kinds of software for a living and weird kinds
of software for a hobby. I mainly work on big data and machine learning type
things these days.

I co-founded [Guild Software](https://vendetta-online.com/) long ago, and have
since worked at Yahoo!, Google, Spotify, and Cisco.

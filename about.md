title: About this site
---
I'm Andy Sloane and I write all kinds of software for a living and weird kinds
of software for a hobby. I mainly work on big data and machine learning type
things these days. I have a wife and two kids and a comfortable life in the SF
Bay Area.

I co-founded [Guild Software](https://vendetta-online.com/), and have
previously worked at Yahoo!, Google, and Spotify.  Right now I'm at a
recently-acquired startup; it would be expensive to recruit me.

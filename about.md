title: About this site
---
I'm Andy Sloane and I write all kinds of software for a living and weird kinds
of software for a hobby. I mainly work on big data and machine learning type
things these days. I have a wife and two kids and a comfortable life in the SF
Bay Area.

I co-founded [Guild Software](https://vendetta-online.com/) long ago, and have
since worked at Yahoo!, Google, and Spotify.  Today I'm at a startup which is
in stealth mode and am not considering other opportunities.

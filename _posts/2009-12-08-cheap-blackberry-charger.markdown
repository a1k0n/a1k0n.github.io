title: Super high-tech BlackBerry charger
---
I got a BlackBerry 8350i from ebay to use with a <a
href="http://boostmobile.com">Boost Mobile</a> prepaid plan.  Boost (as
prepaid plans are in general) is much, much cheaper than the
alternatives when you don't talk on the phone a lot.  And (slow)
unlimited wireless internet is only 35 cents a day which works out to
a little over $10/month.

But anyway, my used BlackBerry turned out to have a broken USB port.
It was mounted entirely with cold solder joints and fell right off
like it wasn't even soldered on when I first tried to charge it up.

Most people would avail themselves of the return policy, but I'm not
most people.

I needed to get updated firmware to get SMS and GPS to work, so I <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/asloane/4164714965/">soldered some
wires on</a>, clipped them to a USB cable, and that worked flawlessly,
to my surprise.

That let me charge it up, too.  So then I had a phone with a full
charge, upgraded firmware, working everything, except it does me no
good just sitting on my desk tethered to a bunch of flimsy wires.  I
clipped off all the wires and ordered a replacement USB port as well
as a cradle charger, and all was well until the battery died.  Which
it pretty much did the next day.

So last night I came up with this:

Two nails driven through a block of wood connected to USB +5V and
ground.  Works like a charm.

BODY:
Lingering narrative concepts and furtive simplistic montage are the
harbingers of the new semiotics!

But language as a patriarchal construct of insipid teledildonics
obscures the struggle for representational power and ideology!

No.  (No no no no no no no no)  Noooo!  We project prefrontally the
supersocietal oppression of convergent transaction with art.

Speak to me now, bad kangaroo<br />
Speak to me now, bad kangaroo<br />
Speak to me now!

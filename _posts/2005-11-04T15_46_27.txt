BODY:
My uncle <a href="http://www.sloaneassociates.com/">Ron</a> asked me,
"Do you know what a blog is?  I have a blog, and I don't even know
what the hell it is."

I feigned ignorance.

But at last, I broke down and made one of my own.  Will it have any
purpose?  Who knows!  I think it might help me flesh out new ideas if
I actually decide to write them down.  It might also take lots of time
away from me, as I write about pointless tangents when I'm supposed to
be working.

Alas, this, my first entry, shall contain no new ideas.  But what I
will do is convert some of the old stuff on my site into retroactive
entries, which is sort of cheating but whatever.  

So anything below this post was written prior to this post, but
reformatted for the blog afterwards.

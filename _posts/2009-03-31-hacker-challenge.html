title: Hacker challenge&#58; Can you make a keygen?
---
<p>I like to reverse-engineer things, and I like number theory.  These
hobbies happen to intersect in the art of reverse-engineering software
license keys.</p>

<p>I won't lie: I've cracked programs.  I've created key generators for
programs.  But I also never distribute them.  I do it for the
challenge, not for the program.</p>

<p>But from a warez d00d perspective, it is infinitely preferable if you
can create a key generator instead of cracking, because then you can
typically get further software updates, and things are just easier for
everyone. </p>

<p>It is sometimes shockingly easy to create a key generator.  Often a
program that checks a license key is structured like this:  </p>

<pre>
  licensestr = get_license_key_modal_dialog()
  validlicensestr = make_valid_license(licensestr);
  if(licensestr == validlicensestr) { ... }
</pre>
  
<p>So now all I have to do is extract your make_valid_license code, feed
it random garbage, and I have a key generator for your program.  One
time I just replaced the call to strcmp() with puts() in a program and
turned it into its own key generator.</p>

<p>Other key generators cycle through a hash of some sort (the hash is
sometimes srand() / rand()) and ensure some check digits, or whatever.
Any way you slice it, it's security through obscurity: you're giving
the end user the code, and if end user can read and understand that
code, they can break it.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be this way.  I have created a self-contained
license key decoder, and I'm distributing the source code to it.  In
my next post, I will reveal all the details and how to create keys for
it.  For now, I want to see whether anyone can break it without having
the "official" key generator.  If so, there's a flaw in my reasoning.
It uses a well-known, public-domain algorithm; that's all I'm going to
say for now.</p>

<p>The code is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://a1k0n.net/code/keydecode.cpp.txt">keydecode.cpp</a> - key
decoder</p>

<p><a href="http://a1k0n.net/code/bn.h.txt">bn.h</a> - quick and dirty bignums</p>

<p>(The web host I'm using has the wrong MIME types on .cpp and .h, so they're
.txts - sorry)</p>

<p>I would like to open up a <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/890yf/hacker_challenge_can_you_make_a_key_generator/">discussion
on reddit</a>.  Undoubtedly many people there will recognize the
algorithm and maybe poke holes in what I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: "maybe poke holes in what I'm doing".  Ha.  More like
drive a cement mixer through it in minutes.  I was pleasantly
surprised to find that this reached #1 on the programming subreddit.
LoneStar309 found a gaping hole which I patched, and tharkban also
found a bug in the final if statement, also fixed.  It's fair game to
make keys that way for the challenge I proposed, I suppose, but I
wanted to see whether the idea would work, not necessarily my poor
implementation of it.  Turns out: no, it won't, and unsurprisingly
it's been done before.  Part 2 coming later.</p>

<p><b>Update 2</b>: <a href="/2009/04/03/hacker-challenge-2.html">Hacker
challenge part 2</a> has been posted.</p>

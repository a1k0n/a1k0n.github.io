 - ASCII art compression and Kolmogorov complexity
   - entropy coding + information theory
   - Huffman  (regular tree building, but also Moffat & Turpin paper, via cbloomrants)
   - RLE
   - 1-run coding

 - Bassline synthesis and z-transforms
   - javascript <audio> tag sucks.  we can generate audio by making a wave file
     in base64 and "loading" that... but you can't stream sound.  so we'll have
     to synth a simple bassline or something; we can't do realtime without
     flash.

 - minimal VM + something?

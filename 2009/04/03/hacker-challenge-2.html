  <p>Well, I guess I'm not quitting my day job to become a cryptographer
any time soon.</p>

<p>As was instantly ascertained on reddit, the key algorithm in my "<a
href="/2009/03/31/hacker-challenge.html">Hacker
Challenge</a>" is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA</a>.
I was hoping that it would take at least an hour to crack the private
key, but alas, I had severely underestimated the time that modern
elliptic-curve and number field sieve integer factorizers would take.
It factored in under a second, which means the key would have to be
many orders of magnitude larger to offer any kind of security.</p>

<p>So within an hour a factorization of <i>n</i> was <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/890yf/hacker_challenge_can_you_make_a_key_generator/c08l4rh">posted
to reddit by c0dep0et</a>.  Even so, <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/890yf/hacker_challenge_can_you_make_a_key_generator/c08l4mg">LoneStar309
pointed out an embarassing implementation mistake</a> which
significantly weakened it (given a valid key, you could generate
several other valid encodings of the same key); I patched this, as I
mentioned in my update.  And then <a
  href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/890yf/hacker_challenge_can_you_make_a_key_generator/c08l9k1">teraflop
  demonstrated posession of a working keygen</a> a couple hours
later.</p>

<p>I wanted the key generator challenge to be possible, and it
definitely wasn't trivial, but it was still far easier than I had
hoped.  Still, I couldn't be happier with the result, and I would like
to thank my fellow programming.redditors for a great discussion.</p>

<p>For those who haven't studied how RSA works in sufficient detail to go
from a factored <i>n</i> to a key generator, go take a moment to read
up on Wikipedia.  Basically the public and private keys, <i>e</i> and
<i>d</i>, are <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">multiplicative
  inverses</a> mod <i>&phi;(n)</i> where <i>&phi;(n)</i> is <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function">Euler's
  totient function</a>.  In the case of <i>n</i>=<i>pq</i> where
<i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are prime, <i>&phi;(n)</i> = (<i>p</i> -
1)(<i>q</i> - 1).  So you use the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm">extended
  euclidean algorithm</a> to find <i>e</i> from <i>d</i> and
<i>&phi;(n)</i>.  If you're using <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>
(I am), you can just call <tt>mpz_invert</tt> to do that.</p>

<p>Once you've recovered <i>e</i> from <i>d</i>, you just RSA-encrypt the
message <i>m</i> = 12345678 + <tt>check_mod</tt>*<i>N</i> where
<i>N</i> is the key number of your choosing and 12345678 is a
<a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number">"nothing
  up my sleeve" number</a> I chose for validating a decryption.
The ciphertext is thus <i>m</i><sup><i>e</i></sup> (mod <i>n</i>),
calculated using <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">exponentiation
  by squaring</a>, mod <i>n</i> at each step (which is what
<tt>expmod</tt> does in <tt>bn.h</tt>), and then you do the reverse of
<tt>decode</tt> to turn the number into a string.</p>

<p>The code I used for generating RSA private key pairs is <a
  href="/code/rsa_genpriv.c.txt">rsa_genpriv.c</a> and for generating
license keys is <a href="/code/rsa_genlic.c.txt">rsa_genlic.c</a>.
These require <a href="http://gmplib.org/">libgmp</a>; the job is just
too big for poor little <tt>bn.h</tt>.</p>

<p>(All my code here is MIT-licensed, by the way, so feel free to
steal it for your own purposes.  By all means, use it instead of some
silly easy-to-duplicate hashing scheme for your application...)</p>

<p>So, will RSA-based license schemes work?  Not with such a short key
length.  Can we just make the key length longer?  Well, that depends.
Your ciphertext is always going to be a number between 2 and <i>n</i>,
if <i>n</i> is 512 bits then so is your ciphertext.  1024 bits is
probably the smallest reasonably secure size you'd want to use for
RSA, which is 205 characters in the A-Y,1-9 code I'm using.  So if
your users are pasting keys out of an email, that's probably fine, but
if they're typing it in by hand off of a CD case, forget it.</p>

<p>Also, this scheme, though cryptographically weak, has some points
in its favor.  If a theoretical cracker disassembles the code, he
absolutely <b>must</b> understand RSA at some level, extract <i>n</i>,
and factor it in order to create a key generator.  I probably wouldn't
have the patience to do it if the least bit of obfuscation were used
in conjunction.  It's totally self-contained (so you don't have to
link in libcrypto or libopenssl or libgmp), so it's pretty much a
drop-in replacement for whatever hashing scheme that most software
tends to use.</p>

<p>And, though the backbone of the challenge was quickly broken, only
one person demonstrated a keygen.  I guess one is all it takes.</p>

<p>Can we do better?  Yes, I think we can do much better.  RSA's
security derives from the difficulty of the integer factorization
problem.  There are two other commonly used classes of asymmetric key
cryptosystems based on harder problems: discrete logarithm and
elliptic curve discrete logarithm.  Each provides more "strengh" per
bit of key than the last.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/890yf/hacker_challenge_can_you_make_a_key_generator/c08l6dl">james_block
  brings up some good points</a> along these lines.  It may not be
possible to create a software license scheme with both short license
codes and enough security to withstand a large, coordinated effort to
break it.  But it's far better to use a license key scheme that could
be broken with a large effort than one that will definitely be broken
with a small effort, when the former is an easy drop-in replacement
for the latter.  Truly uncrackable (in the cryptographic sense)
security will require longer keys and users who paste keys out of
emails.</p>

<p>So here is challenge #2.  I've used another common algorithm which
is no longer encumbered by a patent.  The ciphertext is still slightly
less than 125 bits.  It is not impossible to crack by any means, but
it is much harder (in terms of CPU time necessary) than the previous
one.  And there's always the possibility that I screwed something up
and left a big back door in it, which is a good reason for proposing
the challenge in the first place.</p>

<p>The code:
<br /><a href="/code/keydecode2.cpp.txt">keydecode2.cpp</a> - challenge #2 decoder
<br /><a href="/code/bn.h.txt">bn.h</a> - quick and dirty bignums (updated from
last time)</p>

<p>I plan on issuing one further challenge next week, and there's a
good chance that this one will be broken before then if it receives
the same level of attention as the first one did.</p>

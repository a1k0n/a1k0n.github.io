<h1>Super high-tech BlackBerry charger</h1>
<p>I got a BlackBerry 8350i from ebay to use with a <a href='http://boostmobile.com'>Boost Mobile</a> prepaid plan. Boost (as prepaid plans are in general) is much, much cheaper than the alternatives when you don&#8217;t talk on the phone a lot. And (slow) unlimited wireless internet is only 35 cents a day which works out to a little over $10/month.</p>

<p>But anyway, my used BlackBerry turned out to have a broken USB port. It was mounted entirely with cold solder joints and fell right off like it wasn&#8217;t even soldered on when I first tried to charge it up.</p>

<p>Most people would avail themselves of the return policy, but I&#8217;m not most people.</p>

<p>I needed to get updated firmware to get SMS and GPS to work, so I <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/asloane/4164714965/'>soldered some
wires on</a>, clipped them to a USB cable, and that worked flawlessly, to my surprise.</p>

<p>That let me charge it up, too. So then I had a phone with a full charge, upgraded firmware, working everything, except it does me no good just sitting on my desk tethered to a bunch of flimsy wires. I clipped off all the wires and ordered a replacement USB port as well as a cradle charger, and all was well until the battery died. Which it pretty much did the next day.</p>

<p>So last night I came up with this:</p>

<p>Two nails driven through a block of wood connected to USB +5V and ground. Works like a charm.</p>
